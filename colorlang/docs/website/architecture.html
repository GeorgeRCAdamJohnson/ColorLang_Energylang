        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>ColorLang is a machine-native programming language designed to encode programs as HSV pixel grids. The system architecture consists of several key components that work together to parse, execute, and communicate ColorLang programs.</p>
        <h3>High-Level Components</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Color Parser:</strong> Converts HSV pixel grids into executable instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>Virtual Machine (VM):</strong> Executes parsed ColorLang programs.</li>
            <li><strong>Shared Memory:</strong> Facilitates communication between the VM and host runtime.</li>
            <li><strong>Host Applications:</strong> Integrate with the VM to showcase ColorLang's capabilities.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Data Flow</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The user provides a ColorLang program as an image file.</li>
            <li>The Color Parser decodes the image into instructions.</li>
            <li>The VM executes the instructions, updating registers and shared memory.</li>
            <li>The host application renders the results or communicates them to other systems.</li>
        </ol>
