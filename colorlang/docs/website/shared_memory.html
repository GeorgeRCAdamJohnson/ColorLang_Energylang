        <h2>Shared Memory</h2>
        <p>Shared memory in ColorLang facilitates communication between the Virtual Machine (VM) and host applications. It is a critical component for enabling real-time interactions, such as AI-driven behavior and rendering updates.</p>
        <h3>Key Components</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tilemap:</strong> Represents the game or application environment as a 2D grid.</li>
            <li><strong>Agent State:</strong> Tracks the state of AI agents, including position, emotional state, and performance metrics.</li>
            <li><strong>Cognition Strip:</strong> Represents the decision-making process of the AI agent.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Data Flow</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The VM updates shared memory during program execution.</li>
            <li>Changes are reflected in the tilemap, agent state, and cognition strip.</li>
            <li>The host application can modify shared memory to provide input.</li>
        </ol>
