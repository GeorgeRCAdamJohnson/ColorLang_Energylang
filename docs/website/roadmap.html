        <h2>Roadmap</h2>
        <p>ColorLang aims to revolutionize machine-native programming by enabling seamless communication between machines and AI systems through a visual, HSV-based language. The ultimate goal is to create a system that evolves from procedural logic to adaptive intelligence, eventually achieving AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) capabilities.</p>
        <h3>Version 1.0: Foundational System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Demonstrate ColorLang's ability to encode and execute programs, from simple tasks to complex applications.</li>
            <li>Create a procedurally generated platformer game where a monkey plays automatically.</li>
            <li>Enable communication between machines/AI across a network using ColorLang.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Version 2.0: Autonomous Learning Agent</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Build an agent that can take in tasks via an API and learn from them.</li>
            <li>Expand the ability to generate complex environments and tasks procedurally.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Version 3.0: Simulated Intelligence</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Develop a simulated intelligence capable of reasoning and making decisions based on incomplete information.</li>
            <li>Enable the system to analyze its own performance and refine its logic without external input.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Version 4.0: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Achieve a small-scale AGI capable of reasoning, learning, and dreaming.</li>
            <li>Mimic human neural processes by forming tighter connections between concepts through "color-based" reasoning.</li>
        </ul>
