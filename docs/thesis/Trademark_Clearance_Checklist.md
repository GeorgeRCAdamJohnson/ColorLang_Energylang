# Trademark Clearance and Filing Checklist

Date: November 7, 2025

Scope: Word marks and logo marks for software/dev tools and cloud services (IC 9, IC 42).

## 1) Candidate Marks
- Primary: ColorLang (language)
- Secondary: ColorReact (UI framework)
- Compressor: ColorCompressor / Chromapress / HuePack (pick one)
- Meta-state: MindStrip (alt to “Cognition Strip”)

## 2) Clearance Search
- USPTO TESS search: exact and similar terms; phonetic/visual variants.
- WIPO Global Brand Database: international conflicts.
- Common-law search: web, code hosts, package registries.
- Document hits: mark, owner, goods/services, status, IC classes.

Risk grading:
- Low: No similar marks in IC 9/42.
- Medium: Similar marks in adjacent classes or non-software fields.
- High: Same/similar mark in IC 9/42 for related goods.

## 3) Goods/Services Identification (Draft)
- IC 9: Downloadable computer software for programming, code visualization, and data compression; downloadable libraries for UI rendering.
- IC 42: Software as a service (SaaS) for program visualization, execution, and compression; platform as a service (PaaS) featuring development tools.

## 4) Specimens and Use
- Website pages showing mark near download links/docs.
- Repo README headers showing mark as source identifier.
- Product screenshots featuring the mark in UI/about screens.

## 5) Filing Strategy
- File word marks first (broader protection), then logo/stylized marks.
- Jurisdictions: Start with US; consider EU/UK after clearance.
- Ownership: Ensure consistent entity usage across repos and sites.

## 6) Conflicts Log (Template)
| Candidate | Conflict Mark | Owner | Class | Proximity | Risk | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|-------|-----------|------|-------|
| ColorLang |                |       |       |           |      |       |
| ColorReact|                |       |       |           |      |       |

## 7) Decision Criteria
- Proceed if risk Low/Medium with coexistence likelihood; consider modification if High.
- Prefer coined/unique names if conflicts exist (e.g., “Chromapress”).

## 8) Maintenance
- Reserve domains and social handles.
- Establish brand usage guide (capitalization, ™/® usage, logo clear space).

## 9) Action Items
- [ ] Run TESS and WIPO searches; fill Conflicts Log.
- [ ] Select final mark set; confirm IC descriptions.
- [ ] Prepare specimens (site/README/screenshots).
- [ ] File US applications; docket renewal and office action monitoring.

Note: This checklist is informational; consult counsel for filings.
