# ColorLang Roadmap

## Vision
ColorLang aims to revolutionize machine-native programming by enabling seamless communication between machines and AI systems through a visual, HSV-based language. The ultimate goal is to create a system that evolves from procedural logic to adaptive intelligence, eventually achieving AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) capabilities.

---

## Version 1.0: Foundational System (Target: 1 Week)
### Goals:
- **Core Functionality**:
  - Demonstrate ColorLang's ability to encode and execute programs, from simple tasks (e.g., Hello World) to complex applications.
  - Ensure all commands and logic can be stored and executed in ColorLang.
- **Monkey Platformer**:
  - Create a procedurally generated platformer game where a monkey plays automatically.
  - Integrate adaptive machine learning to improve the monkey's performance by 5% each run.
  - Simulate emotions like frustration and happiness (e.g., frustration when stuck, happiness when reaching a banana).
  - Deploy the game in a React App or HTML page.
- **Networking**:
  - Enable communication between machines/AI across a network using ColorLang.

### Actionable Tasks

#### Core Functionality
- [ ] Write and validate a Hello World program in ColorLang.
- [ ] Demonstrate a more complex application encoded in ColorLang.
- [ ] Ensure all commands and logic are fully functional in the VM.

#### Monkey Platformer
- [ ] Design the procedurally generated platformer environment.
- [ ] Implement monkey AI with adaptive learning to improve performance by 5% per run.
- [ ] Simulate emotional states (e.g., frustration, happiness) in the monkey.
- [ ] Deploy the platformer in a React App or HTML page.

#### Networking
- [ ] Implement `NETWORK_SEND` and `NETWORK_RECV` instructions.
- [ ] Demonstrate communication between two machines using ColorLang.

## Version 2.0: Autonomous Learning Agent
### Goals:
- **Ticket-Based Learning**:
  - Build an agent that can take in tasks (e.g., tickets) via an API and learn from them.
  - Move beyond machine learning to actual procedural learning based on past work and current goals.
- **Enhanced Procedural Generation**:
  - Expand the ability to generate complex environments and tasks procedurally.
- **Demonstrations**:
  - Showcase the agent building and improving applications autonomously.

### Actionable Tasks

#### Ticket-Based Learning
- [ ] Design an API for submitting tasks (tickets) to the agent.
- [ ] Implement procedural learning based on submitted tickets.

#### Enhanced Procedural Generation
- [ ] Expand procedural generation capabilities for complex environments.

#### Demonstrations
- [ ] Showcase the agent building and improving applications autonomously.

## Version 3.0: Simulated Intelligence
### Goals:
- **Advanced Reasoning**:
  - Develop a simulated intelligence capable of reasoning and making decisions based on incomplete information.
- **Self-Improvement**:
  - Enable the system to analyze its own performance and refine its logic without external input.
- **Creative Problem-Solving**:
  - Introduce creativity into the system, allowing it to generate novel solutions and ideas.

### Actionable Tasks

#### Advanced Reasoning
- [ ] Develop algorithms for reasoning with incomplete information.

#### Self-Improvement
- [ ] Implement logic for the system to analyze and refine its own performance.

#### Creative Problem-Solving
- [ ] Introduce creativity algorithms for generating novel solutions.

## Version 4.0: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
### Goals:
- **Human-Like Intelligence**:
  - Achieve a small-scale AGI capable of reasoning, learning, and dreaming.
- **Synaptic-Like Processing**:
  - Mimic human neural processes by forming tighter connections between concepts through "color-based" reasoning.
- **Creativity and Emotion**:
  - Enable the AGI to exhibit creativity and emotional responses, pushing the boundaries of machine intelligence.

### Actionable Tasks

#### Human-Like Intelligence
- [ ] Design a small-scale AGI capable of reasoning and learning.

#### Synaptic-Like Processing
- [ ] Develop "color-based" reasoning to mimic human neural processes.

#### Creativity and Emotion
- [ ] Enable the AGI to exhibit creativity and emotional responses.

## Next Steps
- Focus on completing Version 1.0 within the next week.
- Break down tasks into actionable steps and track progress using the `tickets` folder.
- Regularly review and refine the roadmap to ensure alignment with the project's vision.
