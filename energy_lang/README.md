# EnergyLang: Ultra-Performant, Energy-Efficient Programming Platform

## Vision
A general-purpose programming language and toolchain that enables developers to write ultra-performant, energy-efficient code for any workload and hardware (CPU, GPU, NPU, legacy), with real-time energy insights and seamless integration into modern developer workflows.

## Core Principles

## High-Level Roadmap
1. **Language/DSL Design**
2. **Cross-Compiler & Adaptive Runtime**
3. **Energy Profiling & Optimization Engine**
4. **IDE/Toolchain Integration**
5. **Community, Docs, and Ecosystem**


## Actionable Prompts (Kiro-Style)

 - **"Design a new Energyland program that demonstrates both high performance and low energy usage on legacy hardware. Document your approach and results."**
 - **"Contribute an example to the `examples/` folder that benchmarks Energyland against Python or C on CPU, GPU, and NPU."**
 - **"Write a migration guide for developers moving from a mainstream language (e.g., Python, Rust) to Energyland, focusing on energy/performance gains."**
 - **"Develop a plugin for your favorite IDE that visualizes real-time energy consumption using Energyland's profiling API."**
 - **"Propose a new language feature or syntax for Energyland that could further reduce power draw without sacrificing performance. Justify your idea with research or benchmarks."**
 - **"Test Energyland on a device that is 10+ years old and report on compatibility, performance, and energy usage."**
 - **"Host a community challenge: Who can write the most energy-efficient algorithm in Energyland for a common task (e.g., sorting, matrix multiply)?"**
