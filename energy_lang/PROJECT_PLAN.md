# Energyland Project Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines a multi-team, AI-estimated roadmap for building Energyland: a general-purpose, ultra-performant, energy-efficient programming language and toolchain. Estimates assume a modern, distributed team (10–20+ engineers, 2–3 designers, 2–3 technical writers, 2–3 product managers, QA, and DevOps), leveraging AI-assisted development and best practices.

---

## Phase 1: Language/DSL & Core Infrastructure (6–8 months)
- **Language/DSL design:** Syntax, semantics, type system, energy annotations (2–3 months)
- **Parser, AST, and IR:** Modern compiler frontend (1–2 months)
- **Cross-compiler backend:** Targeting CPU, GPU, NPU, legacy (2–3 months)
- **Adaptive runtime:** Dynamic scheduling, hardware detection, fallback logic (2 months)
- **Initial energy profiling hooks:** Basic integration with OS/hardware APIs (1 month)
- **Deliverables:** Language spec, reference compiler, runtime, basic CLI tools

## Phase 2: Energy Profiling, Optimization, and Tooling (5–7 months)
- **Advanced energy profiling:** Real-time, cross-platform telemetry, visualization (2 months)
- **Optimization engine:** Auto-tuning, ML-guided refactoring, energy/performance tradeoff controls (2–3 months)
- **IDE plugins:** VS Code, JetBrains, CLIs (2 months)
- **Build system/CI/CD integration:** CMake, Bazel, GitHub Actions (1 month)
- **Deliverables:** Profiling dashboard, optimization engine, IDE plugins, CI/CD support

## Phase 3: Ecosystem, Community, and Docs (4–6 months)
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive guides, API docs, migration tools (1–2 months)
- **Community portal:** Forums, hardware profile sharing, benchmarks (1 month)
- **Sample projects:** Real-world demos, legacy hardware validation (1–2 months)
- **Enterprise features:** Team dashboards, policy enforcement, compliance (2 months)
- **Deliverables:** Docs, portal, sample apps, enterprise modules

## Phase 4: Market Expansion & Partnerships (Ongoing)
- **Hardware/cloud partnerships:** ARM, NVIDIA, Intel, cloud providers
- **Certification programs:** Energy-efficient software certification
- **IoT/edge/embedded expansion:** Specialized toolchains, SDKs
- **Ongoing:** Community growth, feature expansion, support

---

## Total Estimated Timeline: 15–21 months (MVP to robust v1)
- **Assumes parallel workstreams, AI-assisted code generation, and modern DevOps.**
- **Single-developer or hobbyist timelines would be 3–5× longer and less realistic for market capture.**

## Key Milestones
- Language/DSL MVP: 6 months
- Profiling/optimization/IDE integration: 12–15 months
- Community/enterprise/market launch: 15–21 months

## Risk Mitigation & Challenge Areas
- Hardware abstraction complexity
- Real-time, cross-platform energy telemetry
- Developer adoption and migration
- Integration with legacy and emerging hardware
- Community and ecosystem growth

## Next Steps
1. Assemble core team and advisors
2. Finalize language/DSL design and technical architecture
3. Begin parallel development of compiler, runtime, and profiling tools
4. Engage early adopters and hardware partners
5. Launch open-source MVP and iterate
