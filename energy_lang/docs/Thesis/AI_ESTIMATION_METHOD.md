# AI Estimation Methodology for EnergyLang

## Approach
- Estimates are based on industry-standard, multi-team, parallel development models
- Leverage AI-assisted code generation, review, and documentation
- Use historical data from similar language/toolchain projects (Rust, Go, TVM, MLIR, etc.)
- Factor in distributed teams, modern DevOps, and open-source community contributions

## Key Principles
- **Parallelization:** Multiple teams work concurrently on compiler, runtime, profiling, and tooling
- **AI Assistance:** Accelerates code, testing, and documentation, but does not replace expert review
- **Realistic Staffing:** 10–20+ engineers, 2–3 designers, 2–3 writers, 2–3 PMs, QA, DevOps
- **Milestone Reviews:** Regular checkpoints for risk assessment and timeline adjustment

## Why Not "One Developer" Timelines?
- Single-developer or hobbyist timelines are 3–5× longer and not viable for market capture
- Real-world impact requires scalable, team-based, and AI-accelerated delivery

*This methodology ensures estimates are credible, challenge assumptions, and reflect real market conditions.*
