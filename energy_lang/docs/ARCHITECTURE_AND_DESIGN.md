## Milestone: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration for Adoption
- Integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) support into Energyland to enable seamless interoperability with AI/ML workflows, data pipelines, and external tools.
- Goals:
  - Allow Energyland programs to be invoked, profiled, and managed via MCP-compatible platforms.
  - Provide adapters and documentation for MCP integration.
  - Demonstrate real-world use cases (e.g., AI benchmarking, energy profiling, automated deployment).
- Impact: Lowers integration barrier, increases adoption in research and industry, and positions EnergyLang as a modern, interoperable language for energy-aware computing.
