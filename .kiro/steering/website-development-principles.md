# Website Development Principles

## Core Development Philosophy

### Start Fresh, Not Patch
- **Principle**: Scrap existing messy websites and build a focused, professional presentation
- **Rationale**: Current sites have scattered content, mixed folders, hardcoded links, and UX inconsistencies
- **Approach**: Create a clean, story-driven website that showcases research journey and findings

### Story-Driven Architecture
- **Landing Focus**: Hero section with key finding (C++ 6x more efficient than Python)
- **Narrative Flow**: Guide users through research journey, methodology, findings, and impact
- **Dual Project Integration**: Present both EnergyLang and ColorLang as complementary demonstrations of technical depth

### Technology Stack Requirements
- **Framework**: Modern React application with Vite for fast development
- **Routing**: React Router for smooth navigation
- **Visualizations**: Chart.js or D3 for interactive data presentations
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for clean, responsive design
- **Data Integration**: Use actual CSV benchmark data for authentic visualizations

## Information Architecture Principles

### Clear Top-Level Structure
1. **Landing** - Compelling overview with key findings
2. **Research** - Methodology and scientific rigor
3. **Findings** - Interactive visualizations and discoveries
4. **Methods** - Technical implementation details
5. **Lessons** - Strategic decisions and AI collaboration
6. **Impact** - Practical applications and recommendations

### User Experience Guidelines
- **Data-Driven Navigation** - Easy to maintain and update
- **Consistent Branding** - Professional visual hierarchy throughout
- **Mobile-First Design** - Responsive across all devices
- **Accessibility Compliance** - WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Performance Optimization** - Fast loading with modern formats
- **Progressive Disclosure** - Reveal content and features as users explore
- **Contextual Guidance** - Toast notifications and tooltips for discovery
- **Engagement Flow** - Encourage continued exploration through suggestions and breadcrumbs

## Content Strategy

### Demonstrate Technical Depth
- **Multiple Domains**: Systems programming, visual languages, energy measurement, compression
- **Sophisticated Engineering**: Hardened harnesses, profiler race solutions, energy canonicalization
- **Cross-Language Expertise**: C++, Python, Rust, Go, Java implementations
- **Database Design**: PostgreSQL schema and semantic auditing

### Showcase Strategic Thinking
- **Evidence-Based Decisions**: Document research that informed hyperscaler pivot
- **Multi-Persona Analysis**: Show AI-assisted decision-making process
- **Professional Self-Assessment**: Honest evaluation with concrete improvement plans
- **Value Preservation**: How original goals were maintained while avoiding high-risk work

### Highlight AI Collaboration
- **Sophisticated Usage**: Prompt engineering, verification workflows, multi-persona reviews
- **Domain-Specific Applications**: Different AI assistance for energy measurement vs visual language design
- **Best Practices**: Using AI for boilerplate while reserving judgment for humans
- **Concrete Examples**: Before/after code improvements and analysis enhancements

## Implementation Guidelines

### Component-Based Architecture
- **Maintainability**: Separate content from presentation logic
- **Updateability**: Easy to add new findings or datasets
- **Reusability**: Consistent components across sections
- **Documentation**: Clear guidance for future updates

### Interactive Elements
- **Data Visualizations**: Filterable charts with hover tooltips
- **ColorLang Demos**: Working interpreter for color programs
- **Benchmark Exploration**: Interactive comparison tools
- **Code Examples**: Syntax highlighting and explanations
- **Discovery Features**: Toast notifications for new sections and features
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal additional content as users engage
- **Contextual Guidance**: Tooltips and hints for interactive elements
- **Exploration Tracking**: Suggest related content based on user journey

### SEO and Social Optimization
- **Meta Tags**: Proper Open Graph and structured data
- **Semantic HTML**: Clear heading hierarchy for SEO
- **Rich Previews**: Compelling social media sharing
- **Modern Media**: WebP images, MP4 instead of GIF
